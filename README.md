# OCR Text Extraction from Images

## üìå Overview  
This Python script extracts text from multiple `.jpg` and `.jpeg` images in a folder using **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**.  
The user can choose between two OCR engines:  

‚úÖ **EasyOCR** ‚Äì Supports multiple languages, better accuracy for some cases.  
‚úÖ **Tesseract OCR** ‚Äì Fast and widely used open-source OCR engine.

## ‚ö° Features  
- üîπ Extracts text from multiple images in a folder  
- üîπ Supports **EasyOCR** and **Tesseract OCR**  
- üîπ Works with `.jpg` and `.jpeg` images  
- üîπ Converts images to grayscale for better OCR accuracy (Tesseract)

## üõ† Installation  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3 installed (python3 --version). Then, install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install easyocr opencv-python pytesseract
```
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Tesseract OCR (if using Tesseract)
Windows: Download & Install Tesseract


üöÄ Usage
Run the Script
```bash
python ocr_script.py
```
Input Steps:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Enter the folder path containing the images.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Choose an OCR engine:

1 ‚Üí EasyOCR

2 ‚Üí Tesseract OCR

3 ‚Üí The script will process all .jpg and .jpeg images in the folder and display the extracted text

## Output:
- With EasyOCR
  ```
  Enter the path to the folder containing images: Task1
  Choose OCR engine:
  1. EasyOCR
  2. Tesseract OCR
  Enter your choice (1 or 2): 1

- With Tesseract OCR
  ```
  Enter the path to the folder containing images: Task1
  Choose OCR engine:
  1. EasyOCR
  2. Tesseract OCR
  Enter your choice (1 or 2): 2

## Conclusion:
From EasyOCR and Tesseract OCR ,EasyOCR give a better response with Captcha and Numerical Values but is not fully accurate
